tkinter notes

simplest tkinter program

	from tkinter import * ### (1)
	
	root = Tk()           ### (2) 
	root.mainloop()       ### (3)

(2) the toplevel window
(3) the event loop, waits for things to happen

widget - gui component that does things
container - container into which can put widgets

	canvas - container for drawing
	Frame(myParent) - frame associated with parent
	.pack() - sets up visual relationship bwetween gui component and its parent (grid & place also do similar things)
		pack(widget,side= {LEFT, RIGHT, TOP, BOTTOM}) - to what side is previous stuff going to be, default is TOP

Button - a widget,
	widgets have attributes stored in local namespace dictionary
		button1 = Button(myContainer)
		button1["text"] = "Hello, World!"
	can also set attributes with .configure() or when instantiating
use classes to structure your programs (duh)

binding - define connection/relationship between - widget, type of event, event handler
	event handler is a method that handles events (like java listener)
	to create event binding use widget.bind(event_type_name, event_handler_name)
	"<Button-1>" event - left-click
	to create command binding set attribute command to fxn
focus - only one widget at a time can have focus, and responds 2 events
	usally focus is selected by clicking or tab etc,
	can use tk_focusFollowsMouse procedure to follow mouse
	focus_force() forces focus on a widget
to pass event to bound handler w/ multiple args have to use lambda or currying..

to control layout of a gui
	widget attributes - ie width, padding
	pack() options - ie padding
	nesting of containers 

controling size of container is hard 2 if contains widgets
